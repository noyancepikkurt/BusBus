# BusBus
After registering and logging into the application, you can buy a bus ticket. First, you will select your departure and arrival cities and date, and then you will be directed to a screen where you can choose a bus departure time. After selecting your bus departure time, you will be directed to a seat selection screen, but please note that you can only select a maximum of 5 seats at the same time. After selecting your seat(s), you will be directed to a screen where you can enter the travel information and names of the passengers who will be using the ticket. Once you have entered this information, you can complete the purchase. After purchasing your ticket, you can view your purchased tickets on the "My Tickets" screen. A unique QR code is generated for each ticket. When you scan the QR code, you can see the ticket details such as the ticket holder, ticket ID, seat number, and date. You can also change your profile picture from the "Settings -> My Profile" section.

I used Firebase to save user infos on sign up page and profile picture changing. Generally, I have used 'segue' to pass data between screens, but I also used UserDefaults and NotificationCenter in the final pages. I practiced using as many different things as I could.
