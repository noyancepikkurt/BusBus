# BusBus
After registering and logging into the application, you can buy a bus ticket. First, you will select your departure and arrival cities and date, and then you will be directed to a screen where you can choose a bus departure time. After selecting your bus departure time, you will be directed to a seat selection screen, but please note that you can only select a maximum of 5 seats at the same time. After selecting your seat(s), you will be directed to a screen where you can enter the travel information and names of the passengers who will be using the ticket. Once you have entered this information, you can complete the purchase.

I used Firebase to save user infos on sign up page. Generally, I have used 'segue' to pass data between screens, but I also used UserDefaults and NotificationCenter in the final pages. I practiced using as many different things as I could.
